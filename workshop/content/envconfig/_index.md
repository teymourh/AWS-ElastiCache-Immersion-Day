Before you start the workshop, you need to setup some resources on AWS that we will use to perfrom the migration. This section describes the steps to provision the AWS resources that are required for this database migration walkthrough. 


- If you are running this workshop in an AWS-sponsored or AWS-staffed event, it is likely that you are given a temporary AWS account environment. 

  - If this is an Event Engine account you need to follow the instructions on [Event Engine AWS Account](../../envconfig/event-engine.html) section.

  - If this is a JAMS challenge account you need to follow the instructions on [JAMS challenge AWS Account](../../envconfig/jams.html) section. 

- If you are running this workshop in your own AWS account, or you are advised by AWS staff to configure the workshop environment manually, you need to follow the instructions on [Regular AWS Account](../../envconfig/regular.html) section.
