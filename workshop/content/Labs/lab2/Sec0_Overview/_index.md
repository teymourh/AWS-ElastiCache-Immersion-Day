This lab demonstrates how to migrate data from redis running on a virtual machine to an AWS ElastiCache Redis cluster.

In this lab we will start a local Redis server on an EC2 instance, populate it with data. Then we will demonstrate how to use the AWS ElastiCache migration option to keep ElastiCache synced up with the original Redis before switching over.
